# Divvy Station Monitor

_A real-time monitor of the Divvy Stations in Chicago._

## Introduction
[Divvy](https://www.divvybikes.com/) is Chicago's bike share system, with 580 stations and 5,800 bikes across Chicagoland. Itâ€™s a fun, affordable and convenient way to get around. 

## Divvy Station Status Monitor
Live station info can be accessed throught Divvy [GBFS JSON Feed](https://gbfs.divvybikes.com/gbfs/gbfs.json).

To visualize the trend of station info, we provide a live [**Divvy Station Monitor**](https://divvystationmonitor.herokuapp.com) with status of each Divvy station during the past week.

These data can be further used to perform time-series analysis and forecasting.
